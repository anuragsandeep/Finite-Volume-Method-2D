# Finite-Volume-Method-2D
# Matlab code to predict the steady state temperature in a 2-D domain
# A line-by-line visitation with two sweeps from left-right and bottom-top
# Sweep is done till solution reaches convergence
# Tri-diagonal algorithm solves the banded matrix form
# Boundary conditions include defined temperature on the left, bottom and top walls and heat flux on the right wall
# A relaxation factor is also included in the Gauss-Seidel scheme
